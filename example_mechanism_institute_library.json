        "details": "An airdrop operates by disbursing tokens to the wallets of selected recipients, often without necessitating any proactive steps on their part. The criteria for selection may encompass a range of factors such as ownership of a specific token or engagement within a particular blockchain by a stipulated date. The airdrop is executed at a preset time, following which the tokens become accessible for the recipients to utilize or trade.\nThe underpinning theory for airdrops stems from marketing principles and network effect dynamics, aiming for wider token distribution and heightened engagement. By dispersing tokens, projects aspire to expand their user base and foster active participation. The mechanism also intertwines with game theory, where recipients, now vested with a stake, are incentivized to partake actively within the ecosystem.\nAdvantages & Applications\nMarketing & User Engagement: Offers a catalyst for new users to interact with the project.\nLoyalty: Can be used to reward existing users for participation, resulting in increased retention or loyalty.\nGovernance: May be used to bootstrap a project\u2019s governance strategy by decentralizing voting tokens.\nLiquidity Enhancement: Can spur trading activity as newly disseminated tokens enter circulation.\nLimitations & Risks\nRegulatory Scrutiny: Looming risk of being categorized as a security offering, subject to regulatory constraints.\nAirdrop farming: Potential to draw in short-term speculators who exploit the mechanism by repeating certain tasks actions (often from multiple addresses) to boost the number of tokens they will receive.\nShort-term sell pressure: Dropping large amounts of tokens to users all at once may cause a large spike in sell pressure if recipients do not have an incentive to hold the token, such as utility or expectation of future rewards.\nPrice manipulation: \u201cLow float, high FDV\u201d airdrops have been used to artificially inflate prices by giving a large percentage of the unlocked supply to professional market makers (see explanation).\nKey Considerations\nTarget Criteria: Define selection criteria to align with your strategic goals.\nTiming Strategy: A poorly timed airdrop could overlap with market events or network congestion, thereby impeding distribution.\nRegulatory Compliance: Consult legal advice to navigate potential securities law implications.\nMonitoring Impact: Track metrics like engagement and trading volume post-airdrop to gauge its effectiveness.\nPush or Pull: Push is gas expensive and can send tokens to dormant addresses. Most projects opt for pull using Merkle root, cryptographic technique to verify eligibility, and allow users to claim their own allocation from the contract. This also prevents tokens from being sent to dormant addresses.\nType of Airdrop: Options include retroactive as in UNI, recurring as in OP, using an options strategy as in Tapioca, or conditional claim as in dYdX. Refer below for examples.\nVesting & Lock-ups: Consider combining airdrops with a vesting or lock-up scheme in order to mitigate short-term sell pressure and align recipients with the long-term success of the project. See SAFE example.\nThis entry was coauthored by Alex Weseley.\n",

Their implementation uses a Merkle tree which has the advantage of verifying whitelisted addresses in logarithmic time, whereas other methods may require linear time.\n15% of the total token supply was minted at genesis to users, historical LPs, and SOCKS holders without any vesting or lock-ups:\nUsers: 400 UNI per account that ever called a Uniswap pair or router contract.\nHistorical LPs: pro-rata, weighted by amount of time liquidity was provided, and total ETH value of the provided liquidity.\nSOCKS holders: 1000 UNI per account that holds at least 1 SOCKS token, or burns SOCKS.\nGithub repo with code they used to retroactively determine UNI airdrop recipients.\nCriticisms of UNI Airdrop According to a great deep dive by Jack Gorman for Dune Analytics, only about 7% of the 250k initial airdrop recipients still held their UNI tokens at the time the data was captured. Only 1% of recipients increased their UNI holdings. 93% of wallets \u2018dumped\u2019 their tokens for the free money. Over 75% of wallets dumped their tokens in the first 7 days. Furthermore, the airdrop seems to have failed at distributing governance and voting power, as today the majority of large UNI holders were not airdrop recipients.\nTomasz Tunguz performs a great analysis of the effectiveness of the UNI airdrop as a marketing channel here. He finds them to be less effective than traditional marketing channels as measured by their payback period."

Additionally, and of equal import, the token will initially be non-transferrable until voted upon by SafeDAO, Safe protocol\u2019s governing body. This will discourage dumping of the token, and incentivize further participation. The airdrop has the express goals of decentralizing governance, rewarding usage, and raising awareness for the project, among others.\nA Snapshot proposal to unlock the tokens failed (SEP #2 Community Initiative To Unpause Token Contract).\nSeveral months after the initial airdrop the community voted to allocate a portion of unclaimed airdrop tokens to wallets that claimed the first airdrop (SEP #5 Redistriubting Unredeemed Tokens From User Airdrop Allocation)."

                    "Worldcoin\u2019s approach to distributing its native token WLD has been widely criticized for the economic design choices made. There is a maximum supply of 10B WLD, as stipulated in the token\u2019s contract. At launch, 143M of these will enter circulation, with 43M of those airdropped to users, with the other 100M loaned to market makers. This means that at launch the only 1.43% of the total supply will be in circulation. The token had a fully diluted value (FDV) of over $30B in its opening hours on the market, in part due to its low float. Many people are concerned that 75% of the tokens maximum supply will enter circulation over the next few years and likely bringing high sell pressure. There are also concerns regarding the loaning of a majority of tokens at launch to market makers. Worldcoin\u2019s official stated purpose for this is to ensure liquidity on exchanges, facilitate price discovery, and enhance price stability. As of October 23, 2023, World Assets Ltd, the legal entity behind Worldcoin, has decided to extend the duration of the loans by another 3 months. Matt Batsinelas of Glass Markets is a bit more skeptical about their motives. The token launched on Optimism. Read more about their tokenomics here (geofenced in the US and other select regions). "

Here's how it worked.\nSetup:\nFomo3D was set up as a lottery game with a timer counting down.\nPlayers could buy keys (tickets) with Ethereum. Each key purchase extended the game's timer up to a maximum limit, usually 24 hours.\nThe price of keys increased incrementally as more were bought.\nThe last person to buy a key when the timer ran out would win the entire prize pool.\nParticipation Costs:\nAll players had to pay to participate, hence the all-pay mechanism. Whether they ended up winning or not, their money was kept in the game's contract.\nIncentive to Play:\nThe prospect of winning a large prize pool incentivized continuous participation.\nDividends: Keyholders received a portion of the ETH from each new key purchase, creating passive income for participants.\nGame Theory Dynamics:\nRational players would assess the probability of winning against the cost of participating and potential reward.\nAs the timer got lower, the incentive to be the last keyholder increased, leading to a flurry of activity and increased prices towards the end.\nEndgame:\nThe game would theoretically end when no new keys were purchased before the timer ran out.\nIn practice, this led to aggressive competition towards the end, with bots and large players trying to be the last buyer.\nCritique and Outcomes:\nIt created a situation where the most invested players were likely those who spent the most but did not win, illustrating the 'all-pay' principle.\nThe game was criticized for being similar to a Ponzi scheme, with late participants paying earlier ones, and a high likelihood of loss.\nIt raised questions about the ethical and practical implications of such games on blockchain technology.\nFor a more in-depth critique, see Matt Stephenson's 2018 post Ethereum, FOMO3D, and Dangerous Game Theory."

See examples section for more.\nLimitations & Risks\nMajority dominance: Approval Voting can favor options that are only moderately preferred by many voters, potentially neglecting options with passionate but smaller support bases.\nLack of expressiveness: It doesn't capture nuanced preferences as ranking systems do, potentially sacrificing granularity in decision-making.\nTactical voting: While strategic voting is less common, it can still occur when voters have strong opinions about certain options.\nKey Considerations\nBalance between breadth and depth: Designers must consider the trade-off between selecting broadly acceptable options and capturing the depth of voter preferences.\nThreshold setting: Establishing the approval threshold (the number of approvals needed to win) is crucial; it can influence the outcome significantly.\nVoter education: Ensuring voters understand how to use Approval Voting effectively and without fear of making mistakes is essential.\nThis entry was coauthored by Alex Weseley.\n",

If the project reaches its funding target by a specified deadline, the money is collected, and the project is executed. If the target is not met, pledges are returned to the contributors. This mechanism addresses the collective action problem and aims to overcome the hesitation individuals have in contributing to a project without assurance that the project will be successfully funded.\nAssurance Contracts are rooted in game theory and draw from concepts related to the provision of public goods. They address the challenge of motivating individuals to contribute to projects where there is uncertainty about the project's success, a classic problem in economics and social science.\nAssurance contracts were heavily used in the ICO era, commonly known as \"soft caps\".\nAdvantages & Applications\nRisk Mitigation: Contributors aren't charged unless the goal is met.\nFosters Collective Action: Encourages public participation by providing a safety net against project failure, which can lead to greater collective contributions.\nFlexible Funding Goals: Funding thresholds can be adjusted to fit the project's needs, making it adaptable to various initiatives.\nLimitations & Risks\nFree-Rider Problem: There is a risk of individuals benefiting from the project without contributing, as they can wait for others to fund it.\nWait-and-See Problem: There may be no strong incentive to pledge if project success is uncertain. Potential contributors may delay pledging until the last moment, causing uncertainty and risking project failure.\nKey Considerations\nFunding Threshold: Mechanism designers should accurately gauge the minimum viable funding required to ensure project success. Setting the threshold too high might deter contributions, while setting it too low may risk project failure.\nTime Constraints: Determining an optimal duration for the funding period is crucial. Too short a period may not allow sufficient time for contributions to accumulate, while too long a period may lead to procrastination among potential contributors.\n",

        "details": "AMMs facilitate the trading of digital assets, by eliminating the need for traditional order books and intermediaries. Instead, they rely on smart contracts.\nHere's how it functions: When a user wants to trade one digital asset for another within an AMM-based decentralized exchange, they interact with a smart contract. This contract is responsible for maintaining a liquidity pool, which contains pairs of assets, e.g., Ethereum and DAI. Users can deposit their assets into these pools in exchange for pool tokens that represent their share of the pool's liquidity.\nThe bonding curve algorithm dynamically adjusts the price of assets within the pool based on the ratio of assets held. As one asset becomes scarcer (i.e., more users trade for it), its price increases according to the curve. Conversely, if users sell an asset, its price decreases. This ensures that the pool always maintains a balance between the two assets.\nTraders can swap one asset for another by interacting with the smart contract, which automatically calculates the appropriate exchange rate based on the bonding curve's algorithm. As more users trade, the bonding curve adapts, allowing the market to find a new equilibrium price continuously.\nAdvantages & Applications\nLiquidity: They provide continuous liquidity for various digital assets, enabling trading at any time.\nAccessibility: AMMs are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, democratizing access to financial markets.\nEfficiency: The automated pricing mechanism and use of smart contracts reduces the need for intermediaries and allows for 24/7 trading.\nToken Launches: AMMs are used for initial token offerings (ICOs) and liquidity bootstrapping events, simplifying token distribution.\nLimitations & Risks\nImpermanent Loss: Liquidity providers may experience losses due to price divergence between the assets in the pool and external market prices.\nLimited Price Discovery: AMMs may struggle with providing accurate price information for assets with low liquidity.\nFront-Running: Vulnerabilities in AMM smart contracts can be exploited by malicious actors to front-run or manipulate trades.\nSlippage: For larger trades, the price may deviate significantly from the expected rate due to the bonding curve.\nKey Considerations\nLiquidity Management: Designers must consider strategies for attracting and retaining liquidity providers, as this is critical for the AMM's performance.\nSecurity: Ensuring the smart contracts are secure and free from vulnerabilities is paramount to prevent exploitation.\nSlippage Tolerance: AMM parameters must be set to accommodate users' tolerance for price slippage.\nPair Selection: Choosing the right asset pairs to create liquidity pools is essential for effective operation.\nBonding Curve: Depending on the intended use of the liquidity pools in the exchange, developers must decide which pricing function they want to implement. Today, most AMMs are some form of Constant Function Market Maker such as Constant Sum, Constant Product, Constant Mean, or some combination of these. Each will result to different levels of liquidity, price impact, and slippage. See here for more information.\nNumber of Assets in Pools: Designers must consider how many assets each liquidity pool can have, as well as the price volatility of these assets. This will have implications on the curve function to be chosen. Some AMMs exclusively allow for dual-asset pools (Uniswap, Curve), while others allow for multi-asset pools (Balancer).\nThis entry was coauthored by Alex Weseley.\n",

        "details": "Batch auctions aggregate buy and sell orders over a specified period and execute them simultaneously at a uniform clearing price. This price is determined when the total quantity of buy orders equals the total quantity of sell orders, ensuring market equilibrium. Unlike continuous trading, where orders are matched in real-time, batch auctions consolidate liquidity at discrete intervals. By aggregating orders, batch auctions can minimize the price impact of large individual trades, protect against MEV attacks, improve price discovery, and enhance gas efficiency in blockchain contexts.\nThe concept of batch auctions originates from market microstructure theory and auction theory in economics and finance. Batch auctions gained relevance on-chain in the late 2010s as a potential solution to front-running and MEV issues. One of the early implementations was the Gnosis Protocol, now CoW Protocol, launched in 2020. Since then, various DEXs have adopted batch auctions, including dYdX. Besides being used for trading, batched auctions have also been used as a fundraising mechanism with fair price discovery, such as in the case of Gnosis Auctions.\nVariations\nDual-asset batch auctions: Trades are executed between two specific assets, with the clearing price determined based on the intersection of supply and demand for those assets.\nMulti-asset batch auctions: Trades involving multiple assets are executed simultaneously, facilitating complex trade combinations and ring trades where several assets can be exchanged in a single transaction sequence.\nAdvantages & Applications\nReduced Market Impact: By aggregating orders, batch auctions can minimize the price impact of large individual orders, benefiting institutional investors and traders with significant positions.\nMEV Protection: Can shield users from MEV attacks by removing the time advantage typically front-runners exploit.\nImproved Price Discovery: Aggregating orders can lead to more accurate and stable pricing, especially in less liquid markets.\nGas Efficiency: Batching multiple trades into a single transaction can significantly reduce gas costs for users.\nLimitations & Risks\nReduced Immediacy: The periodic nature of batch auctions means that orders are not executed instantly, which may be unsuitable for time-sensitive trades. If significant market movements occur between batches, this can lead to outdated prices.\nPotential for Gaming: Sophisticated participants might attempt to manipulate the auction by submitting strategic bids before the cutoff time.\nLiquidity Concerns: In markets with low trading volume, batch auctions might not have sufficient liquidity to function effectively.\nDesign Considerations\nAuction Frequency: Determine the optimal interval between auctions to balance liquidity aggregation with execution speed.\nClearing Price Mechanism: Design a fair and efficient algorithm for determining the uniform clearing price that maximizes executed volume. Create appropriate incentives for solvers who compute optimal order matching if necessary.\nOrder Types: Consider supporting various order types (e.g., limit orders or pegged orders) to cater to different trading strategies.\nCross-Asset Interactions: In multi-asset batch auctions, carefully model how trades in different assets can affect each other within the same batch.\n",

This action directly correlates with the utilization of network services, which can be priced an external currency like USD so that the number of tokens burnt per unit of service can fluctuate rather than their actual cost to users.\nIndependently, the network issues new tokens at a predetermined rate, allocating them to service providers in proportion to their contributions. Crucially, the global minting rate is not linked to the rate of burning, which\u2013all else equal\u2013 can allow for an increase in token value when the rate of burning exceeds minting. This model encourages a positive correlation between service demand and token price.\nAdvantages & Applications:\nStabilized Service Pricing: Provides a stable pricing model for services on decentralized networks.\nValue Growth with Network Usage: As service usage increases (and more tokens are burned), the token's value can increase, benefiting the network and its participants.\nFair Compensation for Service Providers: Ensures that service providers are compensated in a manner that is both sustainable and potentially profitable.\nLimitations & Risks:\nComplex Economic Balance: Achieving the ideal equilibrium between burning and minting is challenging and requires constant monitoring and adjustments.\nSusceptibility to Market Dynamics: The model can be sensitive to large fluctuations in service usage or speculative trading behaviors.\nImplementation Challenges: Particularly for ERC20 tokens, the burn mechanism can create gas inefficiencies.\nKey Considerations:\nDecoupling Minting and Burning Rates: Designers should ensure that the minting rate is not directly correlated with the burning rate, allowing for value appreciation as burning increases.\nEnsuring Provider Profitability: The minting rate must be calibrated to cover the costs of service providers and ideally offer profitability, balancing the ecosystem\u2019s economic incentives.\nAdapting to Service Demand Fluctuations: The mechanism must be flexible enough to adapt to changes in network usage and service demand to maintain economic stability.\n",

                    "The Helium network, a decentralized wireless platform, utilizes the Burn and Mint Equilibrium (BME) model in its token economy through its native Helium Token (HNT). In this implementation, the burning of HNT tokens produces Data Credits (DC), which are used within the network. Here's how the BME model functions in the context of Helium:\nToken Burning (Using Services): Users of the Helium network burn HNT tokens to obtain Data Credits. Data Credits are non-transferable credits used to pay for network services, such as transmitting data over the network. This process of burning HNT to acquire DC reduces the available supply of HNT.\nToken Minting (Compensation for Service Providers): On the other side, the Helium network mints new HNT tokens periodically. These minted tokens are distributed to network participants who provide valuable services to the network. For instance, those who operate Helium hotspots \u2014 devices that create coverage for the network \u2014 are rewarded with newly minted HNT tokens.\nAdapting to Network Usage: The Helium network's tokenomics is designed to adapt in real-time to its usage patterns. As the demand for network services increases (more HNT burned for Data Credits), the value of HNT is expected to rise, given a controlled minting rate. Conversely, if the demand decreases, the value would adjust accordingly."

        "details": "In the buyback and burn model, a network uses its generated income to buy back its native tokens from the market and burns them, effectively reducing the total supply. This is intended to increase the scarcity and, theoretically, the value of each remaining token. The tokens are usually burned by sending them to an irretrievable address, making them unusable.\nThe mechanism is inspired by stock buybacks in traditional finance and also incorporates concepts from the Quantity Theory of Money. According to this theory, the value of money is tied to its supply and velocity, as well as the price and quantity of goods and services in an economy. The theory is often represented by the equation \"MV = PQ.\" In the context of \"Buyback & Burn,\" reducing the supply of tokens (akin to the money supply, or \"M\" in the equation) aims to increase their value (akin to the price level, or \"P\") assuming that other variables like velocity (\"V\") and quantity of services (\"Q\") remain constant. This posits that reducing the supply of a token will, all else being equal, increase its price.\nAdvantages & Applications\nPrice Support: Helps in stabilizing or increasing token price.\nSimplicity: Easier to implement and understand compared to more complex mechanisms.\nTransparency: Burning events are publicly verifiable on the blockchain.\nLimitations & Risks\nShort-Term Focus: May not contribute to long-term project development.\nRegulatory Risk: May be seen as a form of market manipulation in some jurisdictions.\nIrreversible: Once tokens are burned, they cannot be recovered.\nKey Considerations\n",

        "details": "In traditional \"buy and burn\" models, tokens are repurchased from the open market and destroyed to reduce supply and increase scarcity. The \"Buyback & Make\" model modifies this by repurchasing tokens and reallocating them to a network-owned \"smart pool.\" This serves multiple purposes: it acts as an automatic buyback machine, a token issuance pool, and a liquidity provider. Instead of burning the tokens, which could hinder long-term value, they are used for future issuance or other productive purposes. This model capitalizes on programmable liquidity to automate these operations, drastically simplifying code and design.\nThe buyback and burn model is rooted in stock buyback practices from traditional corporate financial management while also incorporating principles from Keynesian economics regarding the reinvestment of capital to stimulate economic growth. This approach focuses on capital assets whose value comes from governance or economic participation. It challenges the notion that scarcity through burning automatically implies value, and instead proposes a model that enhances liquidity, issuance, and governance.\nAdvantages & Applications\nEfficient Capital Utilization: No capital is destroyed, allowing for reinvestment.\nAutomated Operations: Utilizes smart pools for automatic buybacks and issuance.\nDynamic Liquidity Management: Can adjust to market conditions via protocol governance.\nPrice Stability: Can help stabilize token price during market downturns.\nSustainability: Promotes long-term growth by continually capitalizing the system.\nLimitations & Risks\nGovernance Risks: Requires robust governance for effective fund allocation.\nComplexity: Smart pool settings need meticulous tuning and oversight.\nMarket Impact: Sudden large buybacks can distort market prices.\nRegulatory Risks: Legal concerns if tokens have security-like attributes.\nKey Considerations\n",

The underlying smart contract manages the relationships between different conditions, ensuring token fungibility across layers. Users can trade these tokens, effectively betting on the likelihood of various outcomes. When an event occurs, the outcome is verified, often using oracles or external data feeds, and tokens are redeemed based on the result.

Glen Weyl, and Vitalik Buterin, refers to a method for adjusting the influence or weight of individual votes in collective decision-making processes, such as DAO voting or public goods funding. The key idea is to discount votes that are highly correlated with each other to prevent overrepresentation of synchronized groups and to promote more diverse and independent decision-making.\nIn practical terms, this means if a group of voters have similar attributes or have demonstrated similar voting behaviors (high correlation), their collective voting power might be reduced compared to a more diverse group of voters whose decisions are less aligned (low correlation). This approach aims to balance the influence among participants and protect the system from being dominated by a cohesive subgroup, thereby encouraging a more equitable and representative governance structure.\nThis mechanism is a part of broader efforts to enhance governance in decentralized systems by considering the diversity of perspectives and reducing the risk of majoritarian domination or manipulation by well-coordinated groups.\n",

Users can also have \u201cweights\u201d in a cluster, denoting how strongly they belong to it. For example, you could use github repositories as clusters, where if I make n pull requests to that repository, I have a weight of n in that repository\u2019s cluster. In general, round operators can choose what cluster data to use (or they can not use COCM at all, of course).\nCOCM calculates \u201csimilarity scores\u201d between each user and each cluster.\nFinally, COCM runs QF, but then attenuates each project\u2019s funding if many of its donors are similar according to the scores calculated in step 2."

        ],
        "details": "A DAICO combines an initial coin offering (ICO) with a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure. The process begins with an ICO to raise capital, after which all funds are locked into a smart contract controlled by token holders. This smart contract implements a \"tap\" mechanism, allowing a gradual release of funds to the development team at a specific rate measured in wei/sec. Token holders can vote to adjust this tap rate, effectively controlling the flow of funds based on the project\u2019s progress. If dissatisfied with the project\u2019s direction, token holders can vote to \"turn off the tap\" or even initiate a refund process, returning the remaining funds to contributors. This mechanism maintains developer motivation while providing investors with ongoing influence over fund allocation and project direction.\nVitalik Buterin introduced the DAICO concept in 2018 on the ethresear.ch forum. It emerged as a response to the 2017 ICO boom, which saw numerous projects mismanage raised funds or engage in fraudulent activities. Since its introduction, DAICOs have been adopted by several blockchain projects, though not as widely as initially anticipated. Notable implementations include Aragon\u2019s Fundraising App.\nAdvantages & Applications\nAccountability: Ensures that developers are accountable to token holders, reducing the risk of fund mismanagement.\nBalances Community Involvement & Team Control: Offers a middle ground between token holder control and project autonomy. Token holders act as a safeguard against fund misuse without interfering in day-to-day operations, while the project retains control over released funds.\nMitigation of Scams: Reduces the likelihood of exit scams by allowing the community to halt funding if the project fails to deliver.\nFlexibility: Can be adapted to various contribution models (e.g., capped sales, dutch auctions, or interactive offerings) while maintaining the core governance structure.\nLimitations & Risks\nLimited Granularity in Accountability: The binary nature of the \u201ckill switch\u201d mechanism lacks nuance, offering only an all-or-nothing approach. While effective against extreme cases like scams, it fails to provide incremental feedback or incentivize team responsiveness in less severe scenarios.\nConsensus Requirement Overrides Individual Concerns: Individual token holders cannot withdraw their share of funds based on personal dissatisfaction. Instead, it requires group consensus, potentially disregarding minority concerns and limiting the system\u2019s responsiveness to diverse viewpoints.\nPotential for Manipulation: Large token holders could potentially sway votes, especially if the project members hold a significant portion of tokens.\nVoter Apathy: Low participation in voting processes could undermine the effectiveness of the governance mechanism.\nDesign Considerations\nVoting Mechanism: Design a fair and efficient voting mechanism to ensure active participation and accurate representation of token holders.\nIncentive Alignment: Ensure that the incentive structures align the interests of project members and token holders to foster cooperation and project success.\nTransparency: Maintain transparency in project development and fund allocation to build trust among the community.\n",

DACs build upon this by offering an additional bonus to contributors in addition to the refund if the project does not reach its goal. This conditional bonus serves to incentivize contributions and signals confidence in the project's viability, thereby making it a dominant strategy to participate even if one doubts the project will succeed.\nThe idea was first articulated by Alex Tabarrok, 1998. The concept is rooted in game theory, specifically within the context of public goods and the free-rider problem.\nAdvantages & Applications\nSolves Free-Rider Problem: Resolves collective action problems by aligning participant incentives.\nEfficient Allocation: Only funds projects with sufficient public interest.\nSignaling: The bonus acts as a signal of confidence in the project.\nUses: Common applications include crowdfunding for decentralized and community-based projects.\nLimitations & Risks\nCoordination Costs: High initial setup complexity.\nLack of Long-Term Commitment: No guarantee for sustained contributions.\nPotential for Abuse: Malicious actors might exploit the bonus mechanism, contributing privately and then encouraging others not to contribute publicly.\nUpfront Capital Requirement: Requires the project to stake the initial capital required for the bonus.\nKey Considerations\nBonus Calculation: Carefully set the bonus amount to be attractive but not exploitable.\nEarly Sign-up Bonus: Consider the optimal design of the bonus to mitigate the \"wait-and-see\" problem by rewarding earlier contributors more, but not so much that it reduces the incentive for later participants.\nThis entry was coauthored by Scott Auriat.\n",

This may lead to oscillations or system instabilities if not properly configured.\nComplexity: Adding layers of adaptability can complicate system design.\nVulnerability: Potential for exploitation if malicious actors understand the tuning algorithm.\nKey Considerations\nMonitoring Metrics: Determine the most relevant metrics to monitor and adjust.\nParameter Sensitivity: Consider how quickly the parameter should change in response to the monitored metrics. Popular algorithms include moving average, exponential moving average, and logarithmic moving average.\nValidation: Test the algorithm rigorously under different conditions to ensure stability. Consider backtesting on historical data before deployment.\nSecurity: Implement protective measures against potential exploits. Consider fallback mechanisms in case of algorithmic failure.\n",

        "details": "Futarchy combines democratic value-setting with market-based decision-making. Participants vote on key metrics to define success, such as GDP growth or healthcare improvements. Once these metrics are established, prediction markets are created for various policy proposals to achieve these metrics. Participants in these markets buy and sell shares based on their predictions of the success of each policy. The price of each policy's shares reflects the collective belief in its effectiveness. The policy with the highest market price is then implemented, as it is predicted to achieve the best outcome according to the selected metrics.\nEconomist Robin Hanson proposed the concept of futarchy in 2000 in the context of representative democracies, where elected officials manage the implementation of policies and measure success metrics. In 2014, Vitalik Buterin extended Hanson\u2019s conceptualization to a decentralized context where smart contracts would automatically enforce the link between prediction market outcomes and policy execution.\nAdvantages & Applications\nWisdom of Crowds: Leverages collective intelligence and market efficiency for more informed policy decisions.\nImproved Decision-Making: Can enhance the speed of complex decisions and rewards accurate predictions and expertise, potentially leading to better decision-making.\nNuanced Preference Expression: Allows for more detailed expression of preferences and beliefs compared to simple voting systems.\nLimitations & Risks\nOversimplification of Complex Values: Relying on a single metric to guide policy decisions can oversimplify the multifaceted nature of human values and the complex impacts of different policies.\nShort-term Bias: Prediction markets might favor short-term outcomes over long-term benefits that are harder to quantify or predict.\nQuestionable Market Efficiency: Potentially requires the organization to seed liquidity for each decision it needs to make, which could prove expensive for the long tail of decisions.\nMarket Manipulation: Lack of liquidity in the prediction market for each decision could make it subject to manipulation by well-capitalized actors.\nDesign Considerations\nMetric Selection: Carefully choose success metrics that align with long-term goals and resist gaming.\nRobust Prediction Markets & Outcome Verification: Ensure the prediction markets are robust, transparent, and resistant to manipulation. Guarantee that the process for verifying policy outcomes is transparent and reliable.\nLiquidity Provision: Develop strategies to ensure sufficient liquidity in the prediction markets. This might include incentivizing market makers or providing initial liquidity to jumpstart the markets.\n",

        "details": "Graduated sanctions start with minor penalties for first-time or minor rule violations. These penalties escalate according to predefined rules based on the frequency, duration, or severity of a participant's non-compliance. This approach discourages participants from rule violations while concurrently providing an opportunity to correct behavior without imposing severe, immediate penalties.\nGraduated sanctions can prove crucial in maintaining system stability and integrity. They ensure that violations are met with proportionate penalties, preventing minor offenses from being overly punished while still imposing severe penalties for major or repeated violations.\nKey Considerations Designing a system with graduated sanctions requires careful consideration of the escalation scale and the criteria for increasing sanctions. The parameters should be set such that they deter non-compliance while still being fair and not discouraging participation. The system must be transparent so that participants understand the consequences of their actions. Moreover, graduated sanctions should be combined with other mechanism design primitives to ensure system health and integrity. For instance, alongside graduated sanctions, it could be beneficial to implement rewards for compliance and mechanisms to restore participants who have faced sanctions once they rectify their non-compliant behavior.\n",

                    "Ethereum 2.0 uses a system of graduated sanctions to penalize validators that violate protocol rules or stay inactive. These mechanisms help maintain the integrity of the network and incentivize participant activity and adherence to protocol.\nSlashing\nValidators face slashing when they violate specific rules related to the Casper FFG and LMD GHOST consensus mechanisms, such as making conflicting attestations or block proposals. This violation could be seen as potential attempts to attack the network.\nUpon violating the rules, validators are \"slashed\" resulting in a significant loss of stake and their removal from the network. The severity of the penalty is correlated to the extent of the violation.\nInitial Penalty: Upon validation of the offense, validators face an immediate deduction from their balance (1/32 of the effective balance, capped at 1 ETH). Alongside, the validator is queued for exit, with withdrawal only possible approximately 36 days later. This initial penalty discourages any form of self-slashing.\nCorrelation Penalty: After half of the withdrawal period (18 days post-slashing), a second penalty applies. It correlates with the total amount of stake slashed over 36 days around the validator's slashing. This adjustment means isolated incidents receive lighter penalties, while coordinated attacks leading to mass slashing face severe punishment.\nSource: https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/slashing\nInactivity Leak\nThe inactivity leak kicks in when the beacon chain, responsible for finalizing transactions, fails due to large numbers of validators being non-participatory or offline.\nThis triggers two key actions: validators do not receive rewards for attesting to blocks, and non-participating validators start incurring penalties. These penalties are not static; they escalate based on the frequency and duration of a validator's inactivity, embodying the principle of graduated sanctions.\nThe escalating penalty system serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it deters non-participation by imposing a cost on inactivity. Secondly, it allows the network to recover in the event of large-scale validator failure. As penalties increase, the influence of non-participating validators decreases, enabling active validators to regain control, finalize transactions, and return the network to normal operations.\nSource: https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/inactivity\nBoth slashing and inactivity leak mechanisms are examples of graduated sanctions in Ethereum 2.0. They ensure validators' adherence to protocol rules and maintain the network's overall health, mitigating the risks of potential attacks or extended inactivity. Moreover, they function as powerful deterrents against non-compliance, thereby fostering an environment of active participation and adherence to rules."

The coordinator processes all messages after the voting period ends, tallies the votes, and verifies the results on-chain. Zero-knowledge proofs are used to guarantee the correctness of computation, making it impossible for the coordinator to incorrectly process votes and tally results.\nWhile MACI requires trusting the coordinator not to collude or bribe voters, it offers a powerful tool for ensuring the sanctity of on-chain voting when the coordinator remains honest.

        "details": "In a multi-stakeholder governance system, decision-making authority is distributed among different groups or entities that have a vested interest in the outcomes. These stakeholders may include users, investors, developers, community members, and other relevant parties. Each stakeholder group typically has a defined set of rights, responsibilities, and voting power.\nDecisions can be made through various on-chain and off-chain mechanisms such as voting, consensus-building, or even delegation. Depending on the specific structure, some stakeholders may have more influence than others based on factors like ownership stakes, contributions to the project, or expertise in relevant domains.\nMulti-stakeholder governance draws upon democratic principles and social choice theory. It emphasizes the importance of representation and participation in decision-making processes. Additionally, it aligns with the principles of decentralization and decentralization-resistant systems often seen in blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.\nMulti-stakeholder governance takes various forms, each tailored to the unique dynamics of the system it governs. A notable example is bicameral governance, mirroring the structure of many democratic legislative systems, where decision-making is split across two distinct chambers representing different stakeholder groups. This ensures a more balanced and representative decision-making process. Other models include consensus-based governance, where decisions require agreement from all stakeholders, emphasizing collaboration but potentially slowing the process. Rotational governance models circulate decision-making roles among stakeholder groups, ensuring dynamic and diverse leadership. Some systems adopt hybrid approaches, combining direct democratic elements with representative structures, allowing for direct stakeholder votes on critical issues while delegating routine decisions to elected bodies.\nAdvantages & Applications\nInclusivity and Representation: Multi-stakeholder governance ensures that a broad spectrum of interests is considered, leading to decisions that better reflect the collective will of the stakeholders.\nResilience and Adaptability: This mechanism promotes adaptability to changing circumstances, as it can incorporate diverse perspectives and expertise.\nReduced Centralization: It mitigates the risk of decision-making becoming concentrated in the hands of a few.\nLimitations & Risks\nComplexity: Coordinating multiple stakeholders with differing interests can lead to slower decision-making processes, and in some cases, deadlock.\nPotential for Conflicts: Conflicts of interest among stakeholders may arise, necessitating robust conflict resolution mechanisms.\nChallenges in Implementation: Designing effective multi-stakeholder governance systems requires careful consideration of stakeholder categories, rights, and voting mechanisms.\nKey Considerations\nClear Definition of Stakeholder Categories: Define and categorize stakeholders based on relevant criteria, such as ownership, contribution, or expertise.\nBalancing Influence: Determine the weight of each stakeholder's vote or influence based on their level of contribution and alignment with the project's goals.\nConflict Resolution Mechanisms: Establish procedures for resolving disputes or conflicts that may arise among stakeholders.\nTransparency and Accountability: Implement mechanisms for transparent communication, reporting, and accountability to ensure trust among stakeholders.\nThis entry was coauthored by PhilH.\n",

Non-Transferable Token (HON)\nHON tokens are created when a user accepts another user's proposal.\nThese tokens are non-transferable, making them an individual liability rather than an asset.\nThe number of HON tokens held by an individual serves as a measure of their reputation but also their level of obligation in the system.\n2.

It uses feedback loops and structured decision-making processes to ensure all voices are heard without requiring unanimous agreement.

Once an agreement is reached, the OTC smart contract facilitates trustless swapping of assets between the parties.\n",

        "details": "Points function as a flexible accounting system for tracking and rewarding user participation and contributions in a dynamic environment. Unlike simple token rewards, points create a relative measure where the system\u2019s total activity determines each point\u2019s value during a given epoch. The underlying smart contracts manage point issuance, valuation, and redemption, often integrating with external data sources or oracles to determine contribution value and system activity levels. The mechanism\u2019s incentive structure adapts to the level of participation: In periods of low overall contribution, the potential value of each point increases, encouraging more participants to engage. Conversely, as participation surges, the relative value of each point decreases, naturally moderating excessive contributions. This self-balancing feature helps maintain system equilibrium and ensures that rewards remain proportional to the impact of individual contributions relative to the whole. Points systems often incorporate immediate feedback through point accrual and delayed gratification in reward distribution to encourage sustained engagement.\nThe concept of points can be traced back to mining pools for Proof of Work and Proof of Stake blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Off-chain mining pools treat the compute or capital provided by validators as \u2018points\u2019 towards their share of each block reward. In 2021, projects like Coordinape and Praise emerged to help decentralized communities track and reward user contributions to DAOs through points over repeating epochs. Points gained significant traction in 2023 with the launch of point programs by Blast and Eigenlayer, which drove rapid user adoption. This marked a shift from early blockchain systems that primarily used tokens with financial value to incentivize participation. Since then, points systems have been increasingly adopted in blockchain applications, including social media platforms like friend.tech and wallets like Rabby.\nAdvantages & Applications\nAdaptive Incentivization: Points systems can automatically adjust incentives based on participation levels, maintaining an optimal balance of engagement.\nFairness in Reward Distribution: By tying rewards to relative contribution, points ensure that rewards are distributed proportionally to effort and impact.\nGamification: Accumulating points can tap into users\u2019 competitive instincts, driving increased participation and engagement.\nVersatility: Points can be applied across various contexts, from staking or compute contributions to usage incentives and development rewards.\nLimitations & Risks\nValue Uncertainty: Participants may be discouraged by the inability to predict the exact value of their points at the time of contribution.\nPotential for Gaming: Without proper safeguards, users might find ways to accumulate points without providing genuine value to the system.\nReward Delay: The time lag between point accumulation and reward distribution might reduce the immediate incentive for participation.\nDesign Considerations\nEpoch Duration: Balance between providing frequent feedback (shorter epochs) and capturing meaningful contribution patterns (longer epochs).\nPoint Calculation Algorithm: Design a robust algorithm that accurately reflects the desired type and quality of contributions.\nTransparency vs. Anti-Gaming: Determine how much information about the current state of points and participation is revealed, balancing transparency with the need to prevent strategic manipulation.\nReward Pool Allocation: Decide whether to fix the total rewards per epoch or allow it to fluctuate based on overall participation levels or market conditions.\nCarryover Mechanics: Consider whether and how to allow points to carry over between epochs, impacting long-term engagement patterns.\nDiminishing Returns: Implement mechanisms to prevent dominance by a small group of power users, such as diminishing point returns for repeated actions.\n",

Users then upvote or downvote ads based on intensity of preference using a set number of \"voting credits\". These votes are weighted quadratically in order to arrive at a relative set of values that represents the popularity of each ad. Advertisers are then reimbursed based on the sum of the degrees of preference, calculated as a quadratic weighting of the aggregated upvotes minus downvotes. The ad also gets extended or reduced according to this factor.\nThe the initial idea was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in his essay on Quadratic Payments. In it, he argues that public ads, as a subsector of public goods, are a non-optimal good as the public does not have an efficient way to coordinate in selecting the ads that interest them.\nAdvantages & Applications\nImproved Relevance & Engagement: Users see more ads that interest them.\nEfficient Pricing: The reimbursement feature allows for dynamic pricing, aligning the actual cost incurred by advertisers more closely with the ad's effectiveness and user engagement.\nApplicability: Can be integrated into existing advertising platforms, like Brave Ads, as well as decentralized social networks like Lens or Farcaster.\nLimitations & Risks\nSybil Attacks: The system is vulnerable to users creating multiple accounts to manipulate voting.\nComplexity: Implementing a secure and fair quadratic voting system is technically challenging.\nPrivacy Risks: Though the mechanism aims for user- and privacy-centricity, implementing zero-knowledge proofs for secure voting can be difficult.\nKey Considerations\nVote Verification vs. Privacy: Balance is needed between verifying votes to prevent Sybil attacks and maintaining user privacy.\nCampaign Cost Calculation: Advertisers must understand the formula for reimbursement based on downvotes and quadratic fees.\nAd Duration Variance: The mechanism modifies ad durations based on the sum of user preferences, requiring careful monitoring.\nThis entry was coauthored by Bernardo Vicente.\n",

        "details": "Slashing is used to deter and manage potential threats or malicious behavior by network participants. Participants stake their assets as a form of commitment. If they fail to adhere to the protocol rules, they risk losing a portion or all of their staked assets.\nThe concept of slashing is rooted in game theory, specifically the concept of punishment in repeated games. By introducing a cost for malicious actions, it enforces honesty and active participation in the network. \nAdvantages & Applications Slashing is beneficial in maintaining network security and integrity. Slashing has found significant applications in Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain networks like Ethereum 2.0 and Cosmos, where it is used to penalize validators who propose conflicting blocks, double signing, and downtime. It can also be useful in truth games or the oracle problem, where a distributed set of actors needs to reach consensus on an observable fact.\nLimitations & Risks\nWrongful Slashing: The major drawback is the potential for wrongful slashing due to bugs, network issues or honest mistakes. This can lead to centralization if smaller participants cannot afford the risk of being slashed.\nBarrier to Entry: Requiring participants to stake assets can pose a barrier to entry.\nKey Considerations\nDesigners should carefully set the slashing conditions and penalties, making sure to differentiate between intentional malicious behavior and honest mistakes or unforeseen issues.\nNon-financial assets or tokens may also be used as slashing collateral, such as non-transferable reputation points or membership badges (see Non-Transferable Token).\n",

                    "The Gitcoin Slashing Engine is a proof of concept designed by Mechanism Institute to identify and penalize sybil accounts misusing Gitcoin passports to pose as unique humans. The engine aims to provide a solution to coordination games that rely on subjective data submitted by different parties. It ensures that where there is significant agreement, action can be taken automatically and transparently, while also ensuring that the extent of overlap required can be updated and recalibrated based on feedback from the broader community.\nThe Slashing Engine operates through a system of staking and flagging. Users can stake any amount of GTC (Gitcoin's native token). If the staked amount exceeds a certain threshold set by the DAO, the user becomes a \"guardian\". There is no limit on the number of guardians, and the DAO can adjust the staking threshold according to their judgment.\nGuardians have the power to flag any account as a sybil (fraudulent) account. The amount staked by the guardian is recorded as the amountCommitted to the claim that the flagged account is a sybil. The amountCommitted must exceed a specific threshold before it can be unstaked in the passport contract. This threshold is set by the DAO, calculated as the highest amount staked by any guardian multiplied by a CONFIDENCE factor set by the DAO. This ensures that it always requires more than one guardian to cause any account flagged as a sybil to be slashed.\nGuardians can also vote to slash other guardians if they are behaving maliciously (i.e., flagging accounts as sybils who are not). If the number of guardians voting on one guardian to be slashed exceeds a threshold set by the DAO, that guardian is slashed."

        "details": "In a lockdrop, participants lock up a certain amount of an existing cryptocurrency or token in a smart contract for a predetermined period. This locked amount serves as collateral or commitment, demonstrating the participant's interest in the new project or network. At the end of the lock-up period, participants receive a proportionate amount of the new tokens being distributed.\nThe length of the lock-up period and the ratio of new tokens received typically vary based on the specific design of the lockdrop. Projects may choose to have different tiers or periods, allowing participants to choose their level of commitment.\nLockdrop draws on concepts from Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) and Time-Locked Tokens. It leverages the idea of staking and commitment to secure a network, while also involving the distribution of new tokens.\nAdvantages & Applications\nNetwork Security: Lockdrop encourages participants to commit to the new network, which can enhance security and participation in the early stages.\nToken Distribution: It provides a fair and decentralized method for distributing tokens to a wide range of participants, potentially avoiding issues of centralization.\nIncentivizing Early Adopters: Participants who believe in the project's potential are incentivized to lock up their assets, providing an initial user base and network effect.\nLimitations & Risks\nLoss of Liquidity: Participants lose access to their locked assets for the duration of the lock-up period, which can be a downside for those who need liquidity.\nUncertain Future Value: The value of the new tokens received after the lock-up period is uncertain and can be influenced by various market factors.\nComplexity: Designing an effective lockdrop mechanism requires careful consideration of parameters like lock-up period, rewards distribution, and participant eligibility.\nKey Considerations\nLock-up Period: Define the duration participants must commit their tokens. Consider offering different tiers for varying commitment levels.\nRewards Ratio: Determine the ratio at which new tokens will be distributed in exchange for locked assets.\nEligibility Criteria: Clearly specify which tokens are eligible for the lockdrop, as well as any requirements for participation.\nTransparency and Trustlessness: Implement the lockdrop as a smart contract to ensure transparency and eliminate the need for intermediaries.\nThis entry was coauthored by PhilH.\n",

They receive a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) based on their time in the pool.\nStreaming Auctions benefit users by avoiding gas wars, allowing them to commit funds only when they agree with the price, preventing retroactive dilution, eliminating the need to time the market, and guaranteeing allocation. To create a streaming auction, a stream creator specifies variables such as start time, duration, tokens involved, lockup periods, and an optional list of whitelisted participants. Receipt tokens can be issued, which are redeemable for the deposit token at maturity and can be used for various purposes, like collateral or liquidity provision.\nUse cases for Streaming Auctions include fair NFT distribution, fixed-duration liquidity mining programs, acquisition of protocol-controlled value, and DAO treasury diversification.\n",

        ],
        "details": "Token bonding curves are a dynamic pricing mechanism that uses a mathematical formula to determine token prices based on the circulating supply, unlike traditional tokens with market-driven prices. As more tokens are purchased and minted, the price increases along the predefined curve. Conversely, the price decreases when tokens are sold back to the smart contract and burned.\nThis type of token creates a direct relationship between supply and price, allowing for continuous liquidity and automated price discovery without relying on traditional order books or market makers. Token bonding curves should not be confused with the more general automated market makers (AMMs) concept. Whereas AMMs typically refer to an algorithmic secondary market (S-AMM) that enables trading between two or more tokens, token bonding curves refer to the case where an AMM serves as the primary token issuing mechanism (P-AMM).\nThe mechanism originated in 2017, with two key developments occurring in parallel. Bancor introduced \u201csmart tokens\u201d to provide automated liquidity without traditional exchanges. At the same time, Simon de la Rouviere coined the term \u201cbonding curves\u201d and expanded on their potential applications in curation markets.\nVariations Token bonding curves can be implemented using various mathematical curves, each impacting the token\u2019s pricing dynamics differently:\nLinear Bonding Curve: Price increases linearly with the number of tokens issued. Each additional token costs a fixed amount more than the previous one.\nExponential Bonding Curve: Price increases exponentially as more tokens are purchased, resulting in rapid price escalation.\nPolynomial Bonding Curve: Price increases polynomially with the number of tokens issued. For instance, the price could grow quadratically or cubically, making the early tokens significantly cheaper and encouraging early adoption.\nLogarithmic Bonding Curve: Price increases sharply initially but slows down as more tokens are issued.\nSigmoid Bonding Curve: Price follows an S-shaped trajectory, starting slow, accelerating rapidly in the middle, then tapering off as token supply increases. This mimics natural growth patterns, balancing early adopter incentives with long-term price stability. The curve\u2019s steepness and inflection point can be adjusted to suit different project lifecycles, making it versatile for various tokenomic models.\nInverse Bonding Curve: Price that decreases with the number of tokens issued initially but increases after reaching a certain supply threshold.\nMulti-dimensional Bonding Curve: Allows minting of multiple tokens against a single reserve asset or a single token against multiple reserve assets.\nAdvantages & Applications\nEfficient Price Discovery: Bonding curves provide a continuous and algorithmic approach to price discovery, reflecting real-time supply and demand. This reduces the risk of price manipulation and ensures token prices adjust naturally based on market activity.\nBuilt-in Liquidity: The bonding curve mechanism inherently provides liquidity, allowing users to buy or sell tokens at any time directly through the smart contract. This is particularly advantageous for new projects looking to establish a liquid market without relying on external exchanges.\nContinuous Revenue/Fundraising: Projects can use token bonding curves for initial and ongoing fundraising by setting a fee on buys or sells. The continuous pricing model enables a steady inflow of funds as the project grows and attracts more participants, ensuring long-term financial sustainability.\nIncentivizing Early Adoption: Early buyers can potentially benefit from price appreciation as more tokens are minted, encouraging early participation.\nLimitations & Risks\nPrice Volatility: The price of token bonding curves can be highly volatile, especially during the early stages when the token supply is low. Large trades can exacerbate this volatility, leading to significant price swings.\nComplex Implementation: Designing and implementing a bonding curve requires a deep understanding of mathematical and economic principles. This complexity can be a barrier for developers and users, potentially limiting adoption.\nMarket Manipulation: Although bonding curves mitigate some forms of manipulation, they are still susceptible to market dynamics and speculative behavior, which can destabilize the token price.\nDesign Considerations\nCurve Design: Each bonding curve type impacts token price dynamics and incentive structures uniquely, shaping the economic behavior and sustainability of the project. Linear curves offer predictable, steady growth; exponential curves heavily reward early participants but risk unsustainable increases; polynomial curves encourage early adoption with controlled long-term growth; logarithmic curves balance rapid initial growth with later stabilization; sigmoid curves mimic natural growth with early acceleration and later deceleration; inverse curves decrease prices initially but increase after a supply threshold; and multi-dimensional curves support complex economic models with flexible asset interactions. The choice of curve should align with the project's goals, target market, and long-term sustainability plans.\nReserve Ratio: Lower ratios (e.g., 20%) create higher price sensitivity and potential returns but less stability; higher ratios (e.g., 80%) offer more price stability and liquidity but lower potential returns and faster reserve depletion; the optimal ratio balances these factors based on project goals and risk tolerance.\nFee Structure: If implementing a fee, design the mechanism to balance revenue generation for the project with maintaining attractive economics for token holders and liquidity providers. Consider factors such as fee percentage, fee distribution, and the potential for adjusting fees over time.\nFront-Running Protection: Implement mechanisms like Batch Auctions to prevent or mitigate front-running attacks, which can be particularly problematic for token bonding curves.\n",

        "details": "TCRs were initially proposed by Mike Goldin as a way to have a decentralized set of actors essentially curate a list. This could be any form of information \u2014 be it something subjective such as a grocery list, a list of \u201cnoteworthy projects,\u201d or even a more enforceable registry such as an allowlist or blocklist for a forum.\nActions in this system involve nominating, voting, and challenging existing registry items, all controlled through token voting. The incentives and involved parties are structured as the following:\nSelf-interested curators (token holders) create a valuable list to increase the value of their voting power.\nCandidates that wish to be curated into \u201cimportant\u201d lists would effectively buy or petition their way onto the registry.\nConsumers desire a trustworthy north star for curated information.\nThere are also additional incentive systems that keep people from making bad decisions, such as a failed nomination slashing the bond put in place to make that nomination in the first place. In this case, token holders are incentivized to keep the information on the list as noteworthy and \u201cvaluable\u201d as possible to keep the system running and their holdings worth something.\nsource: https://medium.com/@Obstropolos/party-on-tcr-party-af0035199b9\n",

This governance model allows decentralized control over the MakerDAO ecosystem.\nFee Capture through Buyback & Burn Upon paying down a collateralized debt position in DAI to retreive the underslying collateral, the user must also pay a 'stability fee.' This fee is converted into MKR tokens on the open market and then burned, effectively reducing the total supply.

        "details": "In a Web of Trust, each participant (or node) can vouch for the trustworthiness of other nodes. Trust is not binary but rather exists on a spectrum, allowing for a nuanced representation of trust levels. The trustworthiness of a particular node is determined not just by the number of endorsements it receives but also by the trustworthiness of the endorsers themselves. This creates a network where trust propagates and evolves dynamically.\nWoT borrows from social network theory, particularly the concept of transitive trust \u2013 the idea that trust can be extended through a network based on mutual connections. This is akin to how one person might trust a friend's friend in a social context. WoT also draws from decentralized authentication systems like PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), which employs bilateral digital signatures for secure communications. The idea of trust being derived from interconnected endorsements aligns with algorithms like PageRank, which determine the importance of a webpage based on the network of links.\nAdvantages & Applications\nRating System: WoT can be used for decentralized rating systems, where trustworthiness is dynamically scored based on peer reviews.\nIdentity Verification: It offers a framework for decentralized identity verification, reducing reliance on central authorities.\nCurrency/Universal Basic Income (UBI): In cryptocurrency or UBI systems, WoT can help in authenticating participants and preventing fraud.\nLimitations & Risks\nSybil Attacks: The network is vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where an attacker creates multiple fake identities to gain disproportionate influence.\nComplex Network Dynamics: The trust relationships can become complex and hard to manage as the network grows.\nTrust Decay: Over time, trust endorsements might become outdated, leading to a decay in the accuracy of trust assessments.\nKey Considerations\nBalancing Trust and Scalability: Designers must balance the depth of trust relationships with the network's scalability.\nDynamic Trust Updates: Implement mechanisms for the continuous updating and reassessment of trust endorsements.\nMitigating Sybil Attacks: Establish protocols to detect and mitigate the influence of Sybil attacks.\n",

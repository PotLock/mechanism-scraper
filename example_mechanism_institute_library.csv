https://www.mechanism.institute/library/airdrop,Airdrop,Distributing tokens to a designated group of recipients based on certain qualifying criteria.,['Value Distribution'],"An airdrop operates by disbursing tokens to the wallets of selected recipients, often without necessitating any proactive steps on their part. The criteria for selection may encompass a range of factors such as ownership of a specific token or engagement within a particular blockchain by a stipulated date. The airdrop is executed at a preset time, following which the tokens become accessible for the recipients to utilize or trade.
The underpinning theory for airdrops stems from marketing principles and network effect dynamics, aiming for wider token distribution and heightened engagement. By dispersing tokens, projects aspire to expand their user base and foster active participation. The mechanism also intertwines with game theory, where recipients, now vested with a stake, are incentivized to partake actively within the ecosystem.
Advantages & Applications
Marketing & User Engagement: Offers a catalyst for new users to interact with the project.
Loyalty: Can be used to reward existing users for participation, resulting in increased retention or loyalty.
Governance: May be used to bootstrap a project’s governance strategy by decentralizing voting tokens.
Liquidity Enhancement: Can spur trading activity as newly disseminated tokens enter circulation.
Limitations & Risks
Regulatory Scrutiny: Looming risk of being categorized as a security offering, subject to regulatory constraints.
Airdrop farming: Potential to draw in short-term speculators who exploit the mechanism by repeating certain tasks actions (often from multiple addresses) to boost the number of tokens they will receive.
Short-term sell pressure: Dropping large amounts of tokens to users all at once may cause a large spike in sell pressure if recipients do not have an incentive to hold the token, such as utility or expectation of future rewards.
Price manipulation: “Low float, high FDV” airdrops have been used to artificially inflate prices by giving a large percentage of the unlocked supply to professional market makers (see explanation).
Key Considerations
Target Criteria: Define selection criteria to align with your strategic goals.
Timing Strategy: A poorly timed airdrop could overlap with market events or network congestion, thereby impeding distribution.
Regulatory Compliance: Consult legal advice to navigate potential securities law implications.
Monitoring Impact: Track metrics like engagement and trading volume post-airdrop to gauge its effectiveness.
Push or Pull: Push is gas expensive and can send tokens to dormant addresses. Most projects opt for pull using Merkle root, cryptographic technique to verify eligibility, and allow users to claim their own allocation from the contract. This also prevents tokens from being sent to dormant addresses.
Type of Airdrop: Options include retroactive as in UNI, recurring as in OP, using an options strategy as in Tapioca, or conditional claim as in dYdX. Refer below for examples.
Vesting & Lock-ups: Consider combining airdrops with a vesting or lock-up scheme in order to mitigate short-term sell pressure and align recipients with the long-term success of the project. See SAFE example.

The highest bidder wins the item, but everyone else loses their bid money.",['Exchange'],"In all-pay auctions, participants either privately or publicly submit their bids and the highest bidder acquires the item. Unlike standard auctions, losing bidders don't get their bids returned. This creates a unique competitive landscape that affects participant behavior and strategy.
All-pay auctions are used in game theory to model situations where competitors invest resources with no guarantee of success, such as political lobbying. They are closely aligned with the concept of ""war of attrition,"" and draw from the Nash equilibrium for optimal strategies.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/approval-voting,Approval Voting,A voting mechanism that allows voters to express approval for multiple options simultaneously. The winner is the option with the highest number of approvals.,['Governance'],"Each voter can vote for one or more options by ""approving"" them. Unlike traditional voting systems, where voters select a single candidate, this method offers a more nuanced approach.Each of the voter’s choices is weighted equally, and the option with the most votes emerges as the winner.
Approval Voting draws its foundations from social choice theory, a branch of political science and economics concerned with aggregating individual preferences to make collective decisions. It is a simpler alternative to ranked-choice voting methods like Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) or Single Transferable Vote (STV).
Advantages & Applications
Simplicity: Approval Voting is easy for both voters and administrators to understand and implement.
Reduction of strategic voting: Voters can express their true preferences without fear of vote-splitting or wasted votes.
Broad representation: This mechanism tends to produce winners who are broadly acceptable to the electorate.
Uses: This mechanism can be useful in elections, to help with budgeting decisions, ratification of legislation, among others. See examples section for more.
Limitations & Risks
Majority dominance: Approval Voting can favor options that are only moderately preferred by many voters, potentially neglecting options with passionate but smaller support bases.
Lack of expressiveness: It doesn't capture nuanced preferences as ranking systems do, potentially sacrificing granularity in decision-making.
Tactical voting: While strategic voting is less common, it can still occur when voters have strong opinions about certain options.
Key Considerations
Balance between breadth and depth: Designers must consider the trade-off between selecting broadly acceptable options and capturing the depth of voter preferences.
Threshold setting: Establishing the approval threshold (the number of approvals needed to win) is crucial; it can influence the outcome significantly.
Voter education: Ensuring voters understand how to use Approval Voting effectively and without fear of making mistakes is essential.

Flexible Funding Goals: Funding thresholds can be adjusted to fit the project's needs, making it adaptable to various initiatives.
Limitations & Risks
Free-Rider Problem: There is a risk of individuals benefiting from the project without contributing, as they can wait for others to fund it.
Wait-and-See Problem: There may be no strong incentive to pledge if project success is uncertain. Potential contributors may delay pledging until the last moment, causing uncertainty and risking project failure.
Key Considerations
Funding Threshold: Mechanism designers should accurately gauge the minimum viable funding required to ensure project success. Setting the threshold too high might deter contributions, while setting it too low may risk project failure.
Time Constraints: Determining an optimal duration for the funding period is crucial. Too short a period may not allow sufficient time for contributions to accumulate, while too long a period may lead to procrastination among potential contributors.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/automated-market-maker-amm,Automated Market-Maker (AMM),"Decentralized exchange mechanism that employs a mathematical algorithm, known as a bonding curve, to establish the price of an asset in response to market supply and demand dynamics.",['Exchange'],"AMMs facilitate the trading of digital assets, by eliminating the need for traditional order books and intermediaries. Instead, they rely on smart contracts.
Here's how it functions: When a user wants to trade one digital asset for another within an AMM-based decentralized exchange, they interact with a smart contract. This contract is responsible for maintaining a liquidity pool, which contains pairs of assets, e.g., Ethereum and DAI. Users can deposit their assets into these pools in exchange for pool tokens that represent their share of the pool's liquidity.
The bonding curve algorithm dynamically adjusts the price of assets within the pool based on the ratio of assets held. As one asset becomes scarcer (i.e., more users trade for it), its price increases according to the curve. Conversely, if users sell an asset, its price decreases. This ensures that the pool always maintains a balance between the two assets.
Traders can swap one asset for another by interacting with the smart contract, which automatically calculates the appropriate exchange rate based on the bonding curve's algorithm. As more users trade, the bonding curve adapts, allowing the market to find a new equilibrium price continuously.
Advantages & Applications
Liquidity: They provide continuous liquidity for various digital assets, enabling trading at any time.
Accessibility: AMMs are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, democratizing access to financial markets.
Efficiency: The automated pricing mechanism and use of smart contracts reduces the need for intermediaries and allows for 24/7 trading.
Token Launches: AMMs are used for initial token offerings (ICOs) and liquidity bootstrapping events, simplifying token distribution.
Limitations & Risks
Impermanent Loss: Liquidity providers may experience losses due to price divergence between the assets in the pool and external market prices.
Limited Price Discovery: AMMs may struggle with providing accurate price information for assets with low liquidity.
Front-Running: Vulnerabilities in AMM smart contracts can be exploited by malicious actors to front-run or manipulate trades.
Slippage: For larger trades, the price may deviate significantly from the expected rate due to the bonding curve.
Key Considerations
Liquidity Management: Designers must consider strategies for attracting and retaining liquidity providers, as this is critical for the AMM's performance.
Security: Ensuring the smart contracts are secure and free from vulnerabilities is paramount to prevent exploitation.
Slippage Tolerance: AMM parameters must be set to accommodate users' tolerance for price slippage.
Pair Selection: Choosing the right asset pairs to create liquidity pools is essential for effective operation.
Bonding Curve: Depending on the intended use of the liquidity pools in the exchange, developers must decide which pricing function they want to implement. Today, most AMMs are some form of Constant Function Market Maker such as Constant Sum, Constant Product, Constant Mean, or some combination of these. Each will result to different levels of liquidity, price impact, and slippage. See here for more information.
Number of Assets in Pools: Designers must consider how many assets each liquidity pool can have, as well as the price volatility of these assets. This will have implications on the curve function to be chosen. Some AMMs exclusively allow for dual-asset pools (Uniswap, Curve), while others allow for multi-asset pools (Balancer).

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/batch-auction,Batch Auction,Groups individual orders and executes them simultaneously at a uniform clearing price. ,['Exchange'],"Batch auctions aggregate buy and sell orders over a specified period and execute them simultaneously at a uniform clearing price. This price is determined when the total quantity of buy orders equals the total quantity of sell orders, ensuring market equilibrium. Unlike continuous trading, where orders are matched in real-time, batch auctions consolidate liquidity at discrete intervals. By aggregating orders, batch auctions can minimize the price impact of large individual trades, protect against MEV attacks, improve price discovery, and enhance gas efficiency in blockchain contexts.
The concept of batch auctions originates from market microstructure theory and auction theory in economics and finance. Batch auctions gained relevance on-chain in the late 2010s as a potential solution to front-running and MEV issues. One of the early implementations was the Gnosis Protocol, now CoW Protocol, launched in 2020. Since then, various DEXs have adopted batch auctions, including dYdX. Besides being used for trading, batched auctions have also been used as a fundraising mechanism with fair price discovery, such as in the case of Gnosis Auctions.
Variations
Dual-asset batch auctions: Trades are executed between two specific assets, with the clearing price determined based on the intersection of supply and demand for those assets.
Multi-asset batch auctions: Trades involving multiple assets are executed simultaneously, facilitating complex trade combinations and ring trades where several assets can be exchanged in a single transaction sequence.
Advantages & Applications
Reduced Market Impact: By aggregating orders, batch auctions can minimize the price impact of large individual orders, benefiting institutional investors and traders with significant positions.
MEV Protection: Can shield users from MEV attacks by removing the time advantage typically front-runners exploit.
Improved Price Discovery: Aggregating orders can lead to more accurate and stable pricing, especially in less liquid markets.
Gas Efficiency: Batching multiple trades into a single transaction can significantly reduce gas costs for users.
Limitations & Risks
Reduced Immediacy: The periodic nature of batch auctions means that orders are not executed instantly, which may be unsuitable for time-sensitive trades. If significant market movements occur between batches, this can lead to outdated prices.
Potential for Gaming: Sophisticated participants might attempt to manipulate the auction by submitting strategic bids before the cutoff time.
Liquidity Concerns: In markets with low trading volume, batch auctions might not have sufficient liquidity to function effectively.
Design Considerations

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/burn-and-mint-equilibrium-bme,Burn-and-Mint Equilibrium (BME),"Users burn tokens to access network services, reducing the token supply, while service providers receive new tokens minted at a controlled but independent rate.",['Value Capture'],"In BME, tokens burned by users represent service consumption, effectively removing these tokens from circulation. This action directly correlates with the utilization of network services, which can be priced an external currency like USD so that the number of tokens burnt per unit of service can fluctuate rather than their actual cost to users.
Independently, the network issues new tokens at a predetermined rate, allocating them to service providers in proportion to their contributions. Crucially, the global minting rate is not linked to the rate of burning, which–all else equal– can allow for an increase in token value when the rate of burning exceeds minting. This model encourages a positive correlation between service demand and token price.
Advantages & Applications:
Stabilized Service Pricing: Provides a stable pricing model for services on decentralized networks.
Value Growth with Network Usage: As service usage increases (and more tokens are burned), the token's value can increase, benefiting the network and its participants.
Fair Compensation for Service Providers: Ensures that service providers are compensated in a manner that is both sustainable and potentially profitable.
Limitations & Risks:
Complex Economic Balance: Achieving the ideal equilibrium between burning and minting is challenging and requires constant monitoring and adjustments.
Susceptibility to Market Dynamics: The model can be sensitive to large fluctuations in service usage or speculative trading behaviors.
Implementation Challenges: Particularly for ERC20 tokens, the burn mechanism can create gas inefficiencies.
Key Considerations:
Decoupling Minting and Burning Rates: Designers should ensure that the minting rate is not directly correlated with the burning rate, allowing for value appreciation as burning increases.
Ensuring Provider Profitability: The minting rate must be calibrated to cover the costs of service providers and ideally offer profitability, balancing the ecosystem’s economic incentives.
Adapting to Service Demand Fluctuations: The mechanism must be flexible enough to adapt to changes in network usage and service demand to maintain economic stability.

Data Credits are non-transferable credits used to pay for network services, such as transmitting data over the network. This process of burning HNT to acquire DC reduces the available supply of HNT.\nToken Minting (Compensation for Service Providers): On the other side, the Helium network mints new HNT tokens periodically. These minted tokens are distributed to network participants who provide valuable services to the network. For instance, those who operate Helium hotspots — devices that create coverage for the network — are rewarded with newly minted HNT tokens.\nAdapting to Network Usage: The Helium network's tokenomics is designed to adapt in real-time to its usage patterns.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/buyback-and-burn,Buyback & Burn,A financial mechanism aimed at increasing the value of a token by repurchasing it from the open market and then permanently removing it from circulation through burning.,['Value Capture'],"In the buyback and burn model, a network uses its generated income to buy back its native tokens from the market and burns them, effectively reducing the total supply. This is intended to increase the scarcity and, theoretically, the value of each remaining token. The tokens are usually burned by sending them to an irretrievable address, making them unusable.
The mechanism is inspired by stock buybacks in traditional finance and also incorporates concepts from the Quantity Theory of Money. According to this theory, the value of money is tied to its supply and velocity, as well as the price and quantity of goods and services in an economy. The theory is often represented by the equation ""MV = PQ."" In the context of ""Buyback & Burn,"" reducing the supply of tokens (akin to the money supply, or ""M"" in the equation) aims to increase their value (akin to the price level, or ""P"") assuming that other variables like velocity (""V"") and quantity of services (""Q"") remain constant. This posits that reducing the supply of a token will, all else being equal, increase its price.
Advantages & Applications
Price Support: Helps in stabilizing or increasing token price.
Simplicity: Easier to implement and understand compared to more complex mechanisms.
Transparency: Burning events are publicly verifiable on the blockchain.
Limitations & Risks
Short-Term Focus: May not contribute to long-term project development.
Regulatory Risk: May be seen as a form of market manipulation in some jurisdictions.

The ""Buyback & Make"" model modifies this by repurchasing tokens and reallocating them to a network-owned ""smart pool."" This serves multiple purposes: it acts as an automatic buyback machine, a token issuance pool, and a liquidity provider. Instead of burning the tokens, which could hinder long-term value, they are used for future issuance or other productive purposes. This model capitalizes on programmable liquidity to automate these operations, drastically simplifying code and design.
The buyback and burn model is rooted in stock buyback practices from traditional corporate financial management while also incorporating principles from Keynesian economics regarding the reinvestment of capital to stimulate economic growth. This approach focuses on capital assets whose value comes from governance or economic participation. It challenges the notion that scarcity through burning automatically implies value, and instead proposes a model that enhances liquidity, issuance, and governance.
Advantages & Applications
Efficient Capital Utilization: No capital is destroyed, allowing for reinvestment.
Automated Operations: Utilizes smart pools for automatic buybacks and issuance.
Dynamic Liquidity Management: Can adjust to market conditions via protocol governance.
Price Stability: Can help stabilize token price during market downturns.
Sustainability: Promotes long-term growth by continually capitalizing the system.
Limitations & Risks
Governance Risks: Requires robust governance for effective fund allocation.
Complexity: Smart pool settings need meticulous tuning and oversight.
Market Impact: Sudden large buybacks can distort market prices.
Regulatory Risks: Legal concerns if tokens have security-like attributes.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/conditional-token,Conditional Token,Can be redeemed at a particular value based on the outcome of specific conditions or events.,['Exchange'],"Conditional tokens are tradable assets representing potential outcomes of interconnected events within a single market structure. These tokens are created for specific events or conditions, with each token corresponding to a possible outcome. Multiple conditions can be linked, forming a tree-like structure of potential outcomes representing complex scenarios with interdependent events. The underlying smart contract manages the relationships between different conditions, ensuring token fungibility across layers. Users can trade these tokens, effectively betting on the likelihood of various outcomes. When an event occurs, the outcome is verified, often using oracles or external data feeds, and tokens are redeemed based on the result. This structure enables more nuanced information discovery compared to simple binary outcome tokens, as it preserves fungibility in deeper layers of combinatorial markets.
The concept of conditional tokens originates from prediction markets and information economics. Gnosis pioneered its development in the blockchain context by introducing the Conditional Token Framework in 2019. Since their introduction, conditional tokens have been implemented by various platforms, such as Polymarket, to create prediction markets on a wide range of topics, from politics to cryptocurrency prices.
Advantages & Applications
Enhanced Information Discovery: Allows for more granular insights into the relationships between different events and their outcomes.
Flexibility: Supports the creation of simple markets for single events and complex, multi-condition markets.
Fungibility: Maintains token fungibility in deeper layers of combinatorial markets, improving liquidity and trading efficiency.
Limitations & Risks
Liquidity Fragmentation: As markets become more complex, liquidity might be spread thin across numerous conditional outcomes.
Oracle Dependence: Relies on accurate and timely reporting of event outcomes, which can be vulnerable to manipulation or errors.
Market Inefficiencies: In nascent or illiquid markets, prices may not accurately reflect true probabilities, leading to potential mispricing.
Design Considerations
Event Selection: Choose clearly definable events with unambiguous outcomes to ensure market integrity.
Market Structure: Carefully design the hierarchy and relationships between conditions to maximize information value.
Liquidity Provision: Implement incentives to ensure sufficient liquidity across various conditional outcomes.

Glen Weyl, and Vitalik Buterin, refers to a method for adjusting the influence or weight of individual votes in collective decision-making processes, such as DAO voting or public goods funding. The key idea is to discount votes that are highly correlated with each other to prevent overrepresentation of synchronized groups and to promote more diverse and independent decision-making.
In practical terms, this means if a group of voters have similar attributes or have demonstrated similar voting behaviors (high correlation), their collective voting power might be reduced compared to a more diverse group of voters whose decisions are less aligned (low correlation). This approach aims to balance the influence among participants and protect the system from being dominated by a cohesive subgroup, thereby encouraging a more equitable and representative governance structure.
This mechanism is a part of broader efforts to enhance governance in decentralized systems by considering the diversity of perspectives and reducing the risk of majoritarian domination or manipulation by well-coordinated groups.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/daico,DAICO,Allows token holders to control the gradual release of funds to a project after fundraising.,"['Fundraising', 'Governance']","A DAICO combines an initial coin offering (ICO) with a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure. The process begins with an ICO to raise capital, after which all funds are locked into a smart contract controlled by token holders. This smart contract implements a ""tap"" mechanism, allowing a gradual release of funds to the development team at a specific rate measured in wei/sec. Token holders can vote to adjust this tap rate, effectively controlling the flow of funds based on the project’s progress. If dissatisfied with the project’s direction, token holders can vote to ""turn off the tap"" or even initiate a refund process, returning the remaining funds to contributors. This mechanism maintains developer motivation while providing investors with ongoing influence over fund allocation and project direction.
Vitalik Buterin introduced the DAICO concept in 2018 on the ethresear.ch forum. It emerged as a response to the 2017 ICO boom, which saw numerous projects mismanage raised funds or engage in fraudulent activities. Since its introduction, DAICOs have been adopted by several blockchain projects, though not as widely as initially anticipated. Notable implementations include Aragon’s Fundraising App.
Advantages & Applications
Accountability: Ensures that developers are accountable to token holders, reducing the risk of fund mismanagement.
Balances Community Involvement & Team Control: Offers a middle ground between token holder control and project autonomy. Token holders act as a safeguard against fund misuse without interfering in day-to-day operations, while the project retains control over released funds.
Mitigation of Scams: Reduces the likelihood of exit scams by allowing the community to halt funding if the project fails to deliver.
Flexibility: Can be adapted to various contribution models (e.g., capped sales, dutch auctions, or interactive offerings) while maintaining the core governance structure.
Limitations & Risks
Limited Granularity in Accountability: The binary nature of the “kill switch” mechanism lacks nuance, offering only an all-or-nothing approach. While effective against extreme cases like scams, it fails to provide incremental feedback or incentivize team responsiveness in less severe scenarios.
Consensus Requirement Overrides Individual Concerns: Individual token holders cannot withdraw their share of funds based on personal dissatisfaction. Instead, it requires group consensus, potentially disregarding minority concerns and limiting the system’s responsiveness to diverse viewpoints.
Potential for Manipulation: Large token holders could potentially sway votes, especially if the project members hold a significant portion of tokens.
Voter Apathy: Low participation in voting processes could undermine the effectiveness of the governance mechanism.
Design Considerations
Voting Mechanism: Design a fair and efficient voting mechanism to ensure active participation and accurate representation of token holders.

If the project fails to reach its funding goal, participants receive a monetary bonus in addition to a refund.",['Fundraising'],"In a standard assurance contract, participants are guaranteed a refund if a project fails to reach its funding goal. DACs build upon this by offering an additional bonus to contributors in addition to the refund if the project does not reach its goal. This conditional bonus serves to incentivize contributions and signals confidence in the project's viability, thereby making it a dominant strategy to participate even if one doubts the project will succeed.
The idea was first articulated by Alex Tabarrok, 1998. The concept is rooted in game theory, specifically within the context of public goods and the free-rider problem.
Advantages & Applications
Solves Free-Rider Problem: Resolves collective action problems by aligning participant incentives.
Efficient Allocation: Only funds projects with sufficient public interest.
Signaling: The bonus acts as a signal of confidence in the project.
Uses: Common applications include crowdfunding for decentralized and community-based projects.
Limitations & Risks
Coordination Costs: High initial setup complexity.
Lack of Long-Term Commitment: No guarantee for sustained contributions.
Potential for Abuse: Malicious actors might exploit the bonus mechanism, contributing privately and then encouraging others not to contribute publicly.
Upfront Capital Requirement: Requires the project to stake the initial capital required for the bonus.
Key Considerations
Bonus Calculation: Carefully set the bonus amount to be attractive but not exploitable.
Early Sign-up Bonus: Consider the optimal design of the bonus to mitigate the ""wait-and-see"" problem by rewarding earlier contributors more, but not so much that it reduces the incentive for later participants.

Advantages & Applications
Efficiency: Optimizes system resources by automatically adjusting parameters.
Adaptability: Can cope with varying conditions without manual intervention.
Applications: Useful in load balancing, congestion control, and auction systems within distributed environments.
Limitations & Risks
Overfitting: Risk of tuning to local maxima or short-term conditions. This may lead to oscillations or system instabilities if not properly configured.
Complexity: Adding layers of adaptability can complicate system design.
Vulnerability: Potential for exploitation if malicious actors understand the tuning algorithm.
Key Considerations
Monitoring Metrics: Determine the most relevant metrics to monitor and adjust.
Parameter Sensitivity: Consider how quickly the parameter should change in response to the monitored metrics. Popular algorithms include moving average, exponential moving average, and logarithmic moving average.
Validation: Test the algorithm rigorously under different conditions to ensure stability. Consider backtesting on historical data before deployment.
Security: Implement protective measures against potential exploits. Consider fallback mechanisms in case of algorithmic failure.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/futarchy,Futarchy,Combines voting with prediction markets to decide which policies will best achieve success metrics.,['Governance'],"Futarchy combines democratic value-setting with market-based decision-making. Participants vote on key metrics to define success, such as GDP growth or healthcare improvements. Once these metrics are established, prediction markets are created for various policy proposals to achieve these metrics. Participants in these markets buy and sell shares based on their predictions of the success of each policy. The price of each policy's shares reflects the collective belief in its effectiveness. The policy with the highest market price is then implemented, as it is predicted to achieve the best outcome according to the selected metrics.
Economist Robin Hanson proposed the concept of futarchy in 2000 in the context of representative democracies, where elected officials manage the implementation of policies and measure success metrics. In 2014, Vitalik Buterin extended Hanson’s conceptualization to a decentralized context where smart contracts would automatically enforce the link between prediction market outcomes and policy execution.
Advantages & Applications
Wisdom of Crowds: Leverages collective intelligence and market efficiency for more informed policy decisions.
Improved Decision-Making: Can enhance the speed of complex decisions and rewards accurate predictions and expertise, potentially leading to better decision-making.
Nuanced Preference Expression: Allows for more detailed expression of preferences and beliefs compared to simple voting systems.
Limitations & Risks
Oversimplification of Complex Values: Relying on a single metric to guide policy decisions can oversimplify the multifaceted nature of human values and the complex impacts of different policies.
Short-term Bias: Prediction markets might favor short-term outcomes over long-term benefits that are harder to quantify or predict.
Questionable Market Efficiency: Potentially requires the organization to seed liquidity for each decision it needs to make, which could prove expensive for the long tail of decisions.
Market Manipulation: Lack of liquidity in the prediction market for each decision could make it subject to manipulation by well-capitalized actors.
Design Considerations
Metric Selection: Carefully choose success metrics that align with long-term goals and resist gaming.
Robust Prediction Markets & Outcome Verification: Ensure the prediction markets are robust, transparent, and resistant to manipulation. Guarantee that the process for verifying policy outcomes is transparent and reliable.
Liquidity Provision: Develop strategies to ensure sufficient liquidity in the prediction markets. This might include incentivizing market makers or providing initial liquidity to jumpstart the markets.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/graduated-sanctions,Graduated Sanctions,Penalties that increase in severity based on the frequency or degree of rule-breaking.,['Value Distribution'],"Graduated sanctions start with minor penalties for first-time or minor rule violations. These penalties escalate according to predefined rules based on the frequency, duration, or severity of a participant's non-compliance. This approach discourages participants from rule violations while concurrently providing an opportunity to correct behavior without imposing severe, immediate penalties.
Graduated sanctions can prove crucial in maintaining system stability and integrity. They ensure that violations are met with proportionate penalties, preventing minor offenses from being overly punished while still imposing severe penalties for major or repeated violations.
Key Considerations Designing a system with graduated sanctions requires careful consideration of the escalation scale and the criteria for increasing sanctions. The parameters should be set such that they deter non-compliance while still being fair and not discouraging participation. The system must be transparent so that participants understand the consequences of their actions. Moreover, graduated sanctions should be combined with other mechanism design primitives to ensure system health and integrity. For instance, alongside graduated sanctions, it could be beneficial to implement rewards for compliance and mechanisms to restore participants who have faced sanctions once they rectify their non-compliant behavior.
","[{'resource': '', 'resources links': ''}]","[{'example': 'ETH 2.0 Slashing & Inactivity Leak', 'example_details': ['Ethereum 2.0 uses a system of graduated sanctions to penalize validators that violate protocol rules or stay inactive. These mechanisms help maintain the integrity of the network and incentivize participant activity and adherence to protocol.\nSlashing\nValidators face slashing when they violate specific rules related to the Casper FFG and LMD GHOST consensus mechanisms, such as making conflicting attestations or block proposals. This violation could be seen as potential attempts to attack the network.\nUpon violating the rules, validators are ""slashed"" resulting in a significant loss of stake and their removal from the network. The severity of the penalty is correlated to the extent of the violation.\nInitial Penalty: Upon validation of the offense, validators face an immediate deduction from their balance (1/32 of the effective balance, capped at 1 ETH). Alongside, the validator is queued for exit, with withdrawal only possible approximately 36 days later. This initial penalty discourages any form of self-slashing.\nCorrelation Penalty: After half of the withdrawal period (18 days post-slashing), a second penalty applies. It correlates with the total amount of stake slashed over 36 days around the validator\'s slashing. This adjustment means isolated incidents receive lighter penalties, while coordinated attacks leading to mass slashing face severe punishment.\nSource: https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/slashing\nInactivity Leak\nThe inactivity leak kicks in when the beacon chain, responsible for finalizing transactions, fails due to large numbers of validators being non-participatory or offline.\nThis triggers two key actions: validators do not receive rewards for attesting to blocks, and non-participating validators start incurring penalties. These penalties are not static; they escalate based on the frequency and duration of a validator\'s inactivity, embodying the principle of graduated sanctions.\nThe escalating penalty system serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it deters non-participation by imposing a cost on inactivity. Secondly, it allows the network to recover in the event of large-scale validator failure. As penalties increase, the influence of non-participating validators decreases, enabling active validators to regain control, finalize transactions, and return the network to normal operations.\nSource: https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/inactivity\nBoth slashing and inactivity leak mechanisms are examples of graduated sanctions in Ethereum 2.0. They ensure validators\' adherence to protocol rules and maintain the network\'s overall health, mitigating the risks of potential attacks or extended inactivity.

MACI works by having users register their public keys in a smart contract and cast votes as encrypted messages. The coordinator processes all messages after the voting period ends, tallies the votes, and verifies the results on-chain. Zero-knowledge proofs are used to guarantee the correctness of computation, making it impossible for the coordinator to incorrectly process votes and tally results.
While MACI requires trusting the coordinator not to collude or bribe voters, it offers a powerful tool for ensuring the sanctity of on-chain voting when the coordinator remains honest. This makes it popular among applications that rely heavily on the integrity of individual voting choices, such as quadratic funding mechanisms.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/multistakeholder-governance,Multistakeholder Governance,"Representing the distinct interests of different stakeholders in the governance mechanics of a given system. This approach aims to incorporate a diverse range of perspectives, ensuring a more inclusive and resilient decision-making process.",['Governance'],"In a multi-stakeholder governance system, decision-making authority is distributed among different groups or entities that have a vested interest in the outcomes. These stakeholders may include users, investors, developers, community members, and other relevant parties. Each stakeholder group typically has a defined set of rights, responsibilities, and voting power.
Decisions can be made through various on-chain and off-chain mechanisms such as voting, consensus-building, or even delegation. Depending on the specific structure, some stakeholders may have more influence than others based on factors like ownership stakes, contributions to the project, or expertise in relevant domains.
Multi-stakeholder governance draws upon democratic principles and social choice theory. It emphasizes the importance of representation and participation in decision-making processes. Additionally, it aligns with the principles of decentralization and decentralization-resistant systems often seen in blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.
Multi-stakeholder governance takes various forms, each tailored to the unique dynamics of the system it governs. A notable example is bicameral governance, mirroring the structure of many democratic legislative systems, where decision-making is split across two distinct chambers representing different stakeholder groups. This ensures a more balanced and representative decision-making process. Other models include consensus-based governance, where decisions require agreement from all stakeholders, emphasizing collaboration but potentially slowing the process. Rotational governance models circulate decision-making roles among stakeholder groups, ensuring dynamic and diverse leadership. Some systems adopt hybrid approaches, combining direct democratic elements with representative structures, allowing for direct stakeholder votes on critical issues while delegating routine decisions to elected bodies.
Advantages & Applications
Inclusivity and Representation: Multi-stakeholder governance ensures that a broad spectrum of interests is considered, leading to decisions that better reflect the collective will of the stakeholders.
Resilience and Adaptability: This mechanism promotes adaptability to changing circumstances, as it can incorporate diverse perspectives and expertise.
Reduced Centralization: It mitigates the risk of decision-making becoming concentrated in the hands of a few.
Limitations & Risks
Complexity: Coordinating multiple stakeholders with differing interests can lead to slower decision-making processes, and in some cases, deadlock.
Potential for Conflicts: Conflicts of interest among stakeholders may arise, necessitating robust conflict resolution mechanisms.
Challenges in Implementation: Designing effective multi-stakeholder governance systems requires careful consideration of stakeholder categories, rights, and voting mechanisms.
Key Considerations
Clear Definition of Stakeholder Categories: Define and categorize stakeholders based on relevant criteria, such as ownership, contribution, or expertise.
Balancing Influence: Determine the weight of each stakeholder's vote or influence based on their level of contribution and alignment with the project's goals.
Conflict Resolution Mechanisms: Establish procedures for resolving disputes or conflicts that may arise among stakeholders.
Transparency and Accountability: Implement mechanisms for transparent communication, reporting, and accountability to ensure trust among stakeholders.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/points,Points,"Measures individual contributions or participation and allocates rewards proportionally to the systems’ overall contributions over a defined period, after which they can be converted to tangible rewards.",['Value Distribution'],"Points function as a flexible accounting system for tracking and rewarding user participation and contributions in a dynamic environment. Unlike simple token rewards, points create a relative measure where the system’s total activity determines each point’s value during a given epoch. The underlying smart contracts manage point issuance, valuation, and redemption, often integrating with external data sources or oracles to determine contribution value and system activity levels. The mechanism’s incentive structure adapts to the level of participation: In periods of low overall contribution, the potential value of each point increases, encouraging more participants to engage. Conversely, as participation surges, the relative value of each point decreases, naturally moderating excessive contributions. This self-balancing feature helps maintain system equilibrium and ensures that rewards remain proportional to the impact of individual contributions relative to the whole. Points systems often incorporate immediate feedback through point accrual and delayed gratification in reward distribution to encourage sustained engagement.
The concept of points can be traced back to mining pools for Proof of Work and Proof of Stake blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Off-chain mining pools treat the compute or capital provided by validators as ‘points’ towards their share of each block reward. In 2021, projects like Coordinape and Praise emerged to help decentralized communities track and reward user contributions to DAOs through points over repeating epochs. Points gained significant traction in 2023 with the launch of point programs by Blast and Eigenlayer, which drove rapid user adoption. This marked a shift from early blockchain systems that primarily used tokens with financial value to incentivize participation. Since then, points systems have been increasingly adopted in blockchain applications, including social media platforms like friend.tech and wallets like Rabby.
Advantages & Applications
Adaptive Incentivization: Points systems can automatically adjust incentives based on participation levels, maintaining an optimal balance of engagement.
Fairness in Reward Distribution: By tying rewards to relative contribution, points ensure that rewards are distributed proportionally to effort and impact.
Gamification: Accumulating points can tap into users’ competitive instincts, driving increased participation and engagement.
Versatility: Points can be applied across various contexts, from staking or compute contributions to usage incentives and development rewards.
Limitations & Risks
Value Uncertainty: Participants may be discouraged by the inability to predict the exact value of their points at the time of contribution.
Potential for Gaming: Without proper safeguards, users might find ways to accumulate points without providing genuine value to the system.
Reward Delay: The time lag between point accumulation and reward distribution might reduce the immediate incentive for participation.
Design Considerations
Epoch Duration: Balance between providing frequent feedback (shorter epochs) and capturing meaningful contribution patterns (longer epochs).
Point Calculation Algorithm: Design a robust algorithm that accurately reflects the desired type and quality of contributions.
Transparency vs. Anti-Gaming: Determine how much information about the current state of points and participation is revealed, balancing transparency with the need to prevent strategic manipulation.
Reward Pool Allocation: Decide whether to fix the total rewards per epoch or allow it to fluctuate based on overall participation levels or market conditions.
Carryover Mechanics: Consider whether and how to allow points to carry over between epochs, impacting long-term engagement patterns.
Diminishing Returns: Implement mechanisms to prevent dominance by a small group of power users, such as diminishing point returns for repeated actions.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/quadratic-attention-payments,Quadratic Attention Payments,"An advertising mechanism that uses quadratic voting to enhance ad relevance, user engagement, and revenue distribution among stakeholders.","['Value Distribution', 'Data']","First, advertisers pool funds to run their campaigns on a given platform. Users then upvote or downvote ads based on intensity of preference using a set number of ""voting credits"". These votes are weighted quadratically in order to arrive at a relative set of values that represents the popularity of each ad. Advertisers are then reimbursed based on the sum of the degrees of preference, calculated as a quadratic weighting of the aggregated upvotes minus downvotes. The ad also gets extended or reduced according to this factor.
The the initial idea was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in his essay on Quadratic Payments. In it, he argues that public ads, as a subsector of public goods, are a non-optimal good as the public does not have an efficient way to coordinate in selecting the ads that interest them.
Advantages & Applications
Improved Relevance & Engagement: Users see more ads that interest them.
Efficient Pricing: The reimbursement feature allows for dynamic pricing, aligning the actual cost incurred by advertisers more closely with the ad's effectiveness and user engagement.
Applicability: Can be integrated into existing advertising platforms, like Brave Ads, as well as decentralized social networks like Lens or Farcaster.
Limitations & Risks
Sybil Attacks: The system is vulnerable to users creating multiple accounts to manipulate voting.
Complexity: Implementing a secure and fair quadratic voting system is technically challenging.
Privacy Risks: Though the mechanism aims for user- and privacy-centricity, implementing zero-knowledge proofs for secure voting can be difficult.
Key Considerations
Vote Verification vs. Privacy: Balance is needed between verifying votes to prevent Sybil attacks and maintaining user privacy.
Campaign Cost Calculation: Advertisers must understand the formula for reimbursement based on downvotes and quadratic fees.
Ad Duration Variance: The mechanism modifies ad durations based on the sum of user preferences, requiring careful monitoring.

The concept of slashing is rooted in game theory, specifically the concept of punishment in repeated games. By introducing a cost for malicious actions, it enforces honesty and active participation in the network. 
Advantages & Applications Slashing is beneficial in maintaining network security and integrity. Slashing has found significant applications in Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain networks like Ethereum 2.0 and Cosmos, where it is used to penalize validators who propose conflicting blocks, double signing, and downtime. It can also be useful in truth games or the oracle problem, where a distributed set of actors needs to reach consensus on an observable fact.
Limitations & Risks
Wrongful Slashing: The major drawback is the potential for wrongful slashing due to bugs, network issues or honest mistakes. This can lead to centralization if smaller participants cannot afford the risk of being slashed.
Barrier to Entry: Requiring participants to stake assets can pose a barrier to entry.
Key Considerations
Designers should carefully set the slashing conditions and penalties, making sure to differentiate between intentional malicious behavior and honest mistakes or unforeseen issues.
Non-financial assets or tokens may also be used as slashing collateral, such as non-transferable reputation points or membership badges (see Non-Transferable Token).

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/stakedrop,Stakedrop,"A method for distributing tokens to participants who commit and ""lock up"" their existing tokens for a specified period. It serves as a means to bootstrap a network, incentivize early adopters, and secure initial funding for a project.","['Value Distribution', 'Fundraising']","In a lockdrop, participants lock up a certain amount of an existing cryptocurrency or token in a smart contract for a predetermined period. This locked amount serves as collateral or commitment, demonstrating the participant's interest in the new project or network. At the end of the lock-up period, participants receive a proportionate amount of the new tokens being distributed.
The length of the lock-up period and the ratio of new tokens received typically vary based on the specific design of the lockdrop. Projects may choose to have different tiers or periods, allowing participants to choose their level of commitment.
Lockdrop draws on concepts from Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) and Time-Locked Tokens. It leverages the idea of staking and commitment to secure a network, while also involving the distribution of new tokens.
Advantages & Applications
Network Security: Lockdrop encourages participants to commit to the new network, which can enhance security and participation in the early stages.
Token Distribution: It provides a fair and decentralized method for distributing tokens to a wide range of participants, potentially avoiding issues of centralization.
Incentivizing Early Adopters: Participants who believe in the project's potential are incentivized to lock up their assets, providing an initial user base and network effect.
Limitations & Risks
Loss of Liquidity: Participants lose access to their locked assets for the duration of the lock-up period, which can be a downside for those who need liquidity.
Uncertain Future Value: The value of the new tokens received after the lock-up period is uncertain and can be influenced by various market factors.
Complexity: Designing an effective lockdrop mechanism requires careful consideration of parameters like lock-up period, rewards distribution, and participant eligibility.
Key Considerations
Lock-up Period: Define the duration participants must commit their tokens. Consider offering different tiers for varying commitment levels.
Rewards Ratio: Determine the ratio at which new tokens will be distributed in exchange for locked assets.
Eligibility Criteria: Clearly specify which tokens are eligible for the lockdrop, as well as any requirements for participation.
Transparency and Trustlessness: Implement the lockdrop as a smart contract to ensure transparency and eliminate the need for intermediaries.

The average exchange rate for each participant depends on when they deposit and withdraw. They receive a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) based on their time in the pool.
Streaming Auctions benefit users by avoiding gas wars, allowing them to commit funds only when they agree with the price, preventing retroactive dilution, eliminating the need to time the market, and guaranteeing allocation. To create a streaming auction, a stream creator specifies variables such as start time, duration, tokens involved, lockup periods, and an optional list of whitelisted participants. Receipt tokens can be issued, which are redeemable for the deposit token at maturity and can be used for various purposes, like collateral or liquidity provision.
Use cases for Streaming Auctions include fair NFT distribution, fixed-duration liquidity mining programs, acquisition of protocol-controlled value, and DAO treasury diversification.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/token-bonding-curve,Token Bonding Curve,"Issues tokens according to an algorithmic price curve as a function of circulating supply, where token price increases as tokens are purchased on the curve and decreases as tokens are sold back to the curve.","['Fundraising', 'Exchange']","Token bonding curves are a dynamic pricing mechanism that uses a mathematical formula to determine token prices based on the circulating supply, unlike traditional tokens with market-driven prices. As more tokens are purchased and minted, the price increases along the predefined curve. Conversely, the price decreases when tokens are sold back to the smart contract and burned.
This type of token creates a direct relationship between supply and price, allowing for continuous liquidity and automated price discovery without relying on traditional order books or market makers. Token bonding curves should not be confused with the more general automated market makers (AMMs) concept. Whereas AMMs typically refer to an algorithmic secondary market (S-AMM) that enables trading between two or more tokens, token bonding curves refer to the case where an AMM serves as the primary token issuing mechanism (P-AMM).
The mechanism originated in 2017, with two key developments occurring in parallel. Bancor introduced “smart tokens” to provide automated liquidity without traditional exchanges. At the same time, Simon de la Rouviere coined the term “bonding curves” and expanded on their potential applications in curation markets.
Variations Token bonding curves can be implemented using various mathematical curves, each impacting the token’s pricing dynamics differently:
Linear Bonding Curve: Price increases linearly with the number of tokens issued. Each additional token costs a fixed amount more than the previous one.
Exponential Bonding Curve: Price increases exponentially as more tokens are purchased, resulting in rapid price escalation.
Polynomial Bonding Curve: Price increases polynomially with the number of tokens issued. For instance, the price could grow quadratically or cubically, making the early tokens significantly cheaper and encouraging early adoption.
Logarithmic Bonding Curve: Price increases sharply initially but slows down as more tokens are issued.
Sigmoid Bonding Curve: Price follows an S-shaped trajectory, starting slow, accelerating rapidly in the middle, then tapering off as token supply increases. This mimics natural growth patterns, balancing early adopter incentives with long-term price stability. The curve’s steepness and inflection point can be adjusted to suit different project lifecycles, making it versatile for various tokenomic models.
Inverse Bonding Curve: Price that decreases with the number of tokens issued initially but increases after reaching a certain supply threshold.
Multi-dimensional Bonding Curve: Allows minting of multiple tokens against a single reserve asset or a single token against multiple reserve assets.
Advantages & Applications
Efficient Price Discovery: Bonding curves provide a continuous and algorithmic approach to price discovery, reflecting real-time supply and demand. This reduces the risk of price manipulation and ensures token prices adjust naturally based on market activity.
Built-in Liquidity: The bonding curve mechanism inherently provides liquidity, allowing users to buy or sell tokens at any time directly through the smart contract. This is particularly advantageous for new projects looking to establish a liquid market without relying on external exchanges.
Continuous Revenue/Fundraising: Projects can use token bonding curves for initial and ongoing fundraising by setting a fee on buys or sells. The continuous pricing model enables a steady inflow of funds as the project grows and attracts more participants, ensuring long-term financial sustainability.
Incentivizing Early Adoption: Early buyers can potentially benefit from price appreciation as more tokens are minted, encouraging early participation.
Limitations & Risks
Price Volatility: The price of token bonding curves can be highly volatile, especially during the early stages when the token supply is low. Large trades can exacerbate this volatility, leading to significant price swings.
Complex Implementation: Designing and implementing a bonding curve requires a deep understanding of mathematical and economic principles. This complexity can be a barrier for developers and users, potentially limiting adoption.
Market Manipulation: Although bonding curves mitigate some forms of manipulation, they are still susceptible to market dynamics and speculative behavior, which can destabilize the token price.
Design Considerations
Curve Design: Each bonding curve type impacts token price dynamics and incentive structures uniquely, shaping the economic behavior and sustainability of the project. Linear curves offer predictable, steady growth; exponential curves heavily reward early participants but risk unsustainable increases; polynomial curves encourage early adoption with controlled long-term growth; logarithmic curves balance rapid initial growth with later stabilization; sigmoid curves mimic natural growth with early acceleration and later deceleration; inverse curves decrease prices initially but increase after a supply threshold; and multi-dimensional curves support complex economic models with flexible asset interactions. The choice of curve should align with the project's goals, target market, and long-term sustainability plans.
Reserve Ratio: Lower ratios (e.g., 20%) create higher price sensitivity and potential returns but less stability; higher ratios (e.g., 80%) offer more price stability and liquidity but lower potential returns and faster reserve depletion; the optimal ratio balances these factors based on project goals and risk tolerance.
Fee Structure: If implementing a fee, design the mechanism to balance revenue generation for the project with maintaining attractive economics for token holders and liquidity providers. Consider factors such as fee percentage, fee distribution, and the potential for adjusting fees over time.
Front-Running Protection: Implement mechanisms like Batch Auctions to prevent or mitigate front-running attacks, which can be particularly problematic for token bonding curves.

Actions in this system involve nominating, voting, and challenging existing registry items, all controlled through token voting. The incentives and involved parties are structured as the following:
Self-interested curators (token holders) create a valuable list to increase the value of their voting power.
Candidates that wish to be curated into “important” lists would effectively buy or petition their way onto the registry.
Consumers desire a trustworthy north star for curated information.
There are also additional incentive systems that keep people from making bad decisions, such as a failed nomination slashing the bond put in place to make that nomination in the first place. In this case, token holders are incentivized to keep the information on the list as noteworthy and “valuable” as possible to keep the system running and their holdings worth something.

https://www.mechanism.institute/library/web-of-trust-wot,Web of Trust (WoT),Mechanism for establishing and managing trust relationships among entities in a peer-to-peer network based on the endorsements and validations of others within the network.,['Data'],"In a Web of Trust, each participant (or node) can vouch for the trustworthiness of other nodes. Trust is not binary but rather exists on a spectrum, allowing for a nuanced representation of trust levels. The trustworthiness of a particular node is determined not just by the number of endorsements it receives but also by the trustworthiness of the endorsers themselves. This creates a network where trust propagates and evolves dynamically.
WoT borrows from social network theory, particularly the concept of transitive trust – the idea that trust can be extended through a network based on mutual connections. This is akin to how one person might trust a friend's friend in a social context. WoT also draws from decentralized authentication systems like PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), which employs bilateral digital signatures for secure communications. The idea of trust being derived from interconnected endorsements aligns with algorithms like PageRank, which determine the importance of a webpage based on the network of links.
Advantages & Applications
Rating System: WoT can be used for decentralized rating systems, where trustworthiness is dynamically scored based on peer reviews.
Identity Verification: It offers a framework for decentralized identity verification, reducing reliance on central authorities.
Currency/Universal Basic Income (UBI): In cryptocurrency or UBI systems, WoT can help in authenticating participants and preventing fraud.
Limitations & Risks
Sybil Attacks: The network is vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where an attacker creates multiple fake identities to gain disproportionate influence.
Complex Network Dynamics: The trust relationships can become complex and hard to manage as the network grows.
Trust Decay: Over time, trust endorsements might become outdated, leading to a decay in the accuracy of trust assessments.
Key Considerations
Balancing Trust and Scalability: Designers must balance the depth of trust relationships with the network's scalability.
Dynamic Trust Updates: Implement mechanisms for the continuous updating and reassessment of trust endorsements.
Mitigating Sybil Attacks: Establish protocols to detect and mitigate the influence of Sybil attacks.

They can also include delegated reward models where token-holders can delegate tokens to nodes in order to earn a share of rewards. Delegated rewards may or may not be subject to slashing if the delegated to node is slashed.
